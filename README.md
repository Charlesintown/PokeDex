# PokeDex
This is my done task. Finally finished my small adventure with Pokemons!

## Runing the app:
The simplest way to run this app is to clone repository to your local device and run it with: __npm start__ 

I have also deploy this project on Netlify for testing features, so if you want take a look just go directly to the url:
__https://charlesintown-pokedex.netlify.app/#/__

## Tools used are:
* React.js,
* Axios,
* React Bootstrap,
* Reacj-js-pagination,
* React-router,
* SCSS/SASS
